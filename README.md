## Background

I am a very visual person and my motivation comes from me being able to see progress and numbers. With this applicaton, not only can you add in yout workout and stay accountable that way, but you can also clearly see advances and progress in the form of a chart.


## Challenges

I kept running into the challenge of not being able to pull up all the recent workouts, however I was able to resolve that in the routes files.

## Learnings

I learned so much about MongoDB and to deploy an application on Heroku that uses this type of database structure.

## Usage

## Credits

Thank you to Columbia's Full-Stack Web Developer bootcamp for all the assistance and for teaching me all that I have learned. Credit also goes to Google for helping me find any needed resource.
