## Background

I am a very visual person and my motivation comes from me being able to see progress and numbers. With this applicaton, not only can you add in yout workout and stay accountable that way, but you can also clearly see advances and progress in the form of a chart.


## Challenges

I kept running into the challenge of not being able to pull up all the recent workouts, however I was able to resolve that in the routes files.

## Learnings

I learned so much about MongoDB and to deploy an application on Heroku that uses this type of database structure.

## Usage

When launching the app, the user is presented with a short summary of their last workout, if it exists in the database and the option to either continue that workout or to start a new one. From there, whether they select to begin a new oen or to continue their current workout, the steps are the same - the user will select the type of excersice they have performed and enter in all the necessary information. Once entered, they can press "Complete" to complete the workout or "Add Excercise" to add this workout and then have the chance to add another activy as part of the same workout. At any time, the user can click on "Dashboard" in the top left corner and they can see a very detailed summary of their workouts with numbers and charts.
